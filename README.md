# My Blog

Modified from the official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Development

### First time
```
gem install jekyll bundler
npm install
```

### Working locally

Execute in separate windows:
```
jekyll serve --watch
grunt watch
```

## To Do

 - Port original site over? (Or maybe just link)
 - Lots of font/color scheme adjustments
 - Clean git history (we don't need the entire dev line of the clean blog -- that can be squashed and binary images removed)

## Support

Visit Clean Blog's template overview page on Start Bootstrap at http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/ and leave a comment, email feedback@startbootstrap.com, or open an issue here on GitHub for support.
