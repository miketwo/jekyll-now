# My Blog

Modified from the official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Development

### First time
On a Mac: `brew install ruby cmake grunt`

Then:
```
gem install jekyll bundler github-pages
npm install
```

### Working locally

Execute in separate windows:
```
jekyll serve --watch
grunt watch
```

### Adding a post

1. Copy an existing post from `_posts` and rename accordingly.
1. Edit the content of the post until happy.
1. Push to master.


## To Do

 - Clean git history (we don't need the entire dev line of the clean blog -- that can be squashed and binary images removed)
